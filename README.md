# Google Book API Search

For this project, I used React for the first time and created requests to the Google Books API so that a user could search up a book, and have it (and similar search results) appear on the web page. 

My main challenge for this project was deconstrucing the data I recieved back from the API, and sifting through to find the information I required (eg title, author, etc) and then formatting this data. 

To do: book modals
